# Alpha Scope → Vantage: Missing Metrics Gap Analysis

Reference for the metrics Alpha Scope surfaces that Vantage does not (or has the data for but never renders). Provider calls are Alpha Scope's own proxy routes / FMP endpoints, extracted from their live site + JS bundle.

Legend:

- **Alpha Scope** URL for a company metric: `https://alphascope.trade/dashboard/company/<ticker>`
- **Vantage** URL for the same surface: `http://localhost:3000/stock/<ticker>` (company page = `client/pages/Index.tsx`)
- "FMP" = Financial Modeling Prep. Alpha Scope's only data provider (plus OpenAI for AI text).
- **FMP plan tiers** (from `site.financialmodelingprep.com/pricing-plans`, "Compare individual Use Plans"): **Basic** = free, **Starter**, **Premium**, **Ultimate**. The letters `L / A / D / P` shown in FMP's Basic column are *limitation codes*, not plan names: `L` = max N responses per call, `A` = annual-period only, `D` = history capped to N month(s)/year(s), `P` = pagination capped.
- **Implemented?** = whether Vantage already ships the feature today (✅) or it is still a gap (❌).

## ❌ Not done — remaining gaps

### UI only (field already fetched, just needs surfacing)

| Metric | Provider & call (Alpha Scope) | FMP plan (free vs premium) | Where in Alpha Scope | Suggested location in Vantage | Implemented? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dividend payout frequency | Derived from FMP `/stable/dividends` dates ("Quarterly" = 4 payments/yr) | ✅ **Free (Basic)** — max 5 responses/call (`L`) | Company page → "Statistics (TTM)" → Dividend — `https://alphascope.trade/dashboard/company/AAPL` | `client/components/StockFundamentalsStrip.tsx` → "Dividend" group (beside the existing "Payout Date" stub). Dividends already pulled via the aggregator — `http://localhost:3000/stock/MSFT` | ❌ No |

### Needs new FMP fields or endpoints

| Metric | Provider & call (Alpha Scope) | FMP plan (free vs premium) | Where in Alpha Scope | Suggested location in Vantage | Implemented? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| P/E and P/S charted over time | FMP `/stable/ratios` (period = quarter/annual + limit). Alpha Scope proxy: `/api/fmp/ratios` | ✅ **Free (Basic)** — max 5 responses/call (`L`), annual-period only (`A`) | Company page → Charts section, "Price to Earnings Ratio" and "Price to Sales Ratio" cards — `https://alphascope.trade/dashboard/company/AAPL` | New historical-ratio chart cards in `Index.tsx` charts grid + extend `ChartModal`. Vantage currently fetches TTM ratios only (`/api/stock-metrics`) — `http://localhost:3000/stock/MSFT` | ❌ No |
| Peers / comparables table | FMP `/stable/stock-peers` (peer symbols) → per-peer quote + metrics (server-rendered) | ✅ **Free (Basic)** — full access, no limit | Company page → "Peers Similar to …" table (Market Cap, Revenue, Net Income, FCF, P/E, Fwd P/EG, P/B, P/S) — `https://alphascope.trade/dashboard/company/AAPL` | New section below `CompanyProfile.tsx` in `Index.tsx`, backed by a new `/api/stock-peers` route + existing batch-quote/metrics hooks — `http://localhost:3000/stock/MSFT` | ❌ No |

### Needs a new provider (OpenAI, not FMP)

| Metric | Provider & call (Alpha Scope) | FMP plan (free vs premium) | Where in Alpha Scope | Suggested location in Vantage | Implemented? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Catalysts | OpenAI (`/api/openai/positives`, POST `{symbol}`) → `output_text` → `{positiveCatalysts:[{catalyst, details}]}` | ⚠️ **Not FMP** — OpenAI API (separate key, pay-per-token; free tier = limited trial credits) | Company page → "More Information" → "Positive Catalysts" + "Generate AI Summary" button — `https://alphascope.trade/dashboard/company/AAPL` | New panel in `client/pages/Index.tsx` near `CompanyProfile.tsx`, behind a new `/api/openai/positives` route. Vantage has no LLM provider yet — needs a key + provider-health wiring — `http://localhost:3000/stock/MSFT` | ❌ No |
| Risks | OpenAI (`/api/openai/risks`, POST `{symbol}`) → `output_text` → `{risks:[{risk, details}]}` | ⚠️ **Not FMP** — OpenAI API (separate key, pay-per-token) | Company page → "More Information" → "Risks" + "Generate AI Summary" button — `https://alphascope.trade/dashboard/company/AAPL` | New panel beside Catalysts in `Index.tsx`, behind a new `/api/openai/risks` route — `http://localhost:3000/stock/MSFT` | ❌ No |

## Notes

- **Every FMP endpoint Alpha Scope uses is on the free (Basic) plan.** Verified against FMP's "Compare individual Use Plans" matrix: `profile`, `balance-sheet-statement`, `dividends`, `ratios-ttm`, `key-metrics-ttm`, `revenue-product-segmentation`, `ratios`, `stock-peers`, and the market-movers all show **Full** or **Limited** coverage in the Basic column — none are gated behind Starter/Premium/Ultimate. The "premium" aspects are only *depth limits* (response caps, ~87-ticker symbol whitelist, annual-only periods), not hard paywalls.
- **The only true premium dependency is OpenAI** (Catalysts/Risks): a separate billed provider, unrelated to FMP's plan tiers.
- **Trending was previously mislabeled as "needs a higher FMP tier"** — that's wrong. The movers endpoints are free; Vantage's 404s come from calling the old `/stable/gainers` and `/actives` paths, which FMP renamed to `/stable/biggest-gainers`, `/stable/biggest-losers`, and `/stable/most-actives`. Fix the paths, not the plan.
- **Everything Alpha Scope shows is FMP + OpenAI.** Logos and news thumbnails come from `images.financialmodelingprep.com`; financials/ratios/peers/segment data all route through its own `/api/fmp/*` proxy routes (see the client bundle) or are server-rendered from FMP.
- **Vantage already has the FMP plumbing** (`stockService.ts` normalizes profile/statements/ratios/metrics/dividends), so the "UI only" gap is near-free, the "new FMP fields" items are additive field/route work, and only Catalysts/Risks require a genuinely new integration.
- **Status snapshot (post PR #21/#22):** 7 of 12 gaps shipped — Company website, Net Debt, Trending browse, Revenue by segment, and P/CF · P/FCF · ROIC. 5 remain: dividend payout frequency, P/E·P/S history, peers table, catalysts, risks.

// Hebrew-letter sector glyphs for the third tier of `TickerLogo`'s
// fallback ladder. Renders a single Hebrew letter + sector-tinted background
// in place of a company logo when neither Logo.dev's ticker nor name tiers
// could resolve.
//
// The mapping is HE-locale ONLY. EN-locale users skip straight from the
// name tier to plain initials (per the ladder's first-second-fourth path),
// because English-speaking readers are not expected to recognize Hebrew
// letters as sector indicators — they're a cultural-locale affordance for
// RTL Hebrew speakers.
//
// Why single letters rather than short Hebrew words?
//   - Tile space is 32–64 CSS pixels; multi-character strings get clipped
//     or wrap unpredictably. One letter fits any size cleanly.
//   - Hebrew initial letters map to the brand Hebrew term for the sector
//     (ט for טכנולוגיה, פ for פיננסים, ב for בריאות, etc.), which is
//     recognizable to native readers without explanation.
//
// Sector strings come from FMP's `/stable/profile` (canonical English).
// If FMP adds new sectors, fall through to `null` and the ladder proceeds
// to the initials tier rather than throwing a render-time exception.

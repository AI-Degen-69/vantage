/**
 * Per-row deferred renderer for the Insights grid. Below the fold we render a
 * static skeleton matched to the project's loading-row style (`h-[150px]`,
 * `bg-card rounded-lg p-4 border border-border`). Once the row enters
 * the viewport — including a 200px preheat margin so tightly-grouped
 * scroll-spurts don't reveal a flash of skeleton — we swap in the real
 * children. The IntersectionObserver for each row disconnects after the
 * first intersection, so the post-mount runtime is bounded regardless of
 * total row count.
 *
 * Why per-row IO instead of a shared observer?
 *   - One observer per row keeps the lifetime scope tight: each row's
 *     effect owns its own `disconnect()` and never re-subscribes after
 *     first-paint. The cost is N observer objects, which is fine for
 *     the N=70 universe. Centralizing to a single observer would save a
 *     few cycles but couple subscribers and complicate scrolling-with-
 *     newly-mounted-rows (e.g. tab switches that append new symbols).
 *
 * Why an IO wrapper instead of react-window / react-virtual?
 *   - IO gives us "defer until in view, then render once and forget"
 *     without a virtualization library, accessibility debt, or row-height
 *     bookkeeping. The cards remain in the document at full DOM weight
 *     (just skeleton content), so search-input filtering and screen-
 *     reader semantics keep working as-is. Trade-off: we still keep
 *     ~70 residue DOM nodes after first scroll past the bottom; that's
 *     small in practice (a few ms of layout) and not worth a dep for.
 *
 * SSR / pre-2020 browser fallback:
 *   If `IntersectionObserver` isn't available, we mount the children
 *   immediately. The alternative — permanent skeletons on ancient browsers
 *   — is a worse UX.
